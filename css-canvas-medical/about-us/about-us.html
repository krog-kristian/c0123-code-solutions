            <h2>Clinicians should have software they love.</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable, intelligent tools
              to advance their practice of medicine - and improve their day-to-day.

          <p>Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve
            the quality and efficiency of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Workflows are
            overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.
          </p>
          <p>We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft the mixes
            art and science - technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across the country, we think we
            have begun to build somehting that helps.
