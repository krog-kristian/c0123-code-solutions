      <h3 class="text-cen larger-title">Calculate an estimate of your ROI with Canvas</h3>
      <ol class="pad-quart">
        <li>Making the Decision to Switch
          <p>You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
            unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this dtermination one way or the other. We
            will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
            about their experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Interfaces and Community Integration
          <p>Canvas is meant to integrate with oyur existing interfaces and community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling
            your payers with our clearinghouse, and ggetting bidirection lab feeds runing. We'll also load your preffered specialists and imagin centers
            into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other
            information technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver
            and when.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Data Migration
          <p>The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which we have executed successfully
          with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics
          and information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes
          and documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of
          EMRs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Training and Site Visit
          <p>We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge schedules, and much more.
          Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical,
          practice management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to
          work side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Go-Live and Tuning
          <p>Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be with you, either in-person or
          remotely depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you
          have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations,
          modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Sustained Performance
          <p>All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide support over the long term. Our
          Performance Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all
          payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive
          a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect
          this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
          </p>
