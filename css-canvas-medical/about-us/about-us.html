            <p>Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable, intelligent tools

          <p>Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve
            the quality and efficiency of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Workflows are
            overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.
          </p>
          <p>We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft the mixes
            art and science - technology can help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across the country, we think we
            have begun to build somehting that helps.

      <h3 class="text-cen">Our Story</h3>

      <p>Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna &#151; a family nurse practitioner &#151;
        sacrifice family time in the evenings to &quot;finish&quot; charting. It never ended.
      </p>
      <p>Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He started to fill the gaps in his experience.
        Seven practicing clinicians formed the clinical advisory board &#151; rather than leave to practice to work full-time
        with Canvas, they used and reviewed product changes in their practices. Our Medical Director, Dr. Zimmerman, joined when he saw the potential of Canvas
        to help independent practices like his practice, Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland, Ca. Julian joined Canvas after working at Medicare
        and seeing the failures of current technology to keep up with increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe and a
        world class group of software developers joined to accelerate our ability to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improce the product.
      </p>
      <p>With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that completely eliminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The name of the company describes the
        charting experience &#151; it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell the patient's story and seamlessly complete notes, orders, and char
        review on a single, unified screen. With seamlessly integrated population health, billing, and practice management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern
        primary care practice.
